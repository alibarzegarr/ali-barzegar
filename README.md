# Ali Barzegar — AI Mechanical Systems Architect (AIMSA)

**Mechanical Systems + AI + Automation**

I specialize in designing **AI-enhanced mechanical systems** that sense, learn, and optimize their own performance.  
My work combines mechanical engineering fundamentals with **machine learning**, **signal processing**, and **edge computing** — to build intelligent, data-driven physical systems.
